# deproject-data

Example data for the Sherpa
[deproject module](https://deproject.readthedocs.io/).

The data provided here is placed into the public domain. It was
used in
[Forman et al 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2005ApJ...635..894F) 
and was provided by Paul Nulsen. It is intended *only* as an
example data set for exploring how to use the deproject module,
and should not be used for Scientific analysis (for one thing,
the calibration data for Chandra may have changed since the
observation was analyzed).
